# general design

* non-linear,multi-tennant communication
* groud-defined conversations with access control
* small number of dependencies: git, sh, coreutils

# essentials

* basic chat functionality
* multiple conversations
* mutable history
* "contact list"

# special features

* self-destructing messages
* file-transfer support
* per conversation read/write access control
* backend should be easy-to-use, even without any frontend -- i.e. you should be
able to use (most of) the messenger with simple git commands

# maybes

* transparant E2E cryptography ?
