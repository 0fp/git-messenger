# way to go

* access-control on hosting level (e.g. gitlab).
[git repository access control](https://wincent.com/wiki/Git_repository_access_control)

# spit-balling

this is basically dedicated to stream-of-consciousness
* message is empty file with random UID as name, use commit message
* master branch role: complete log of all conversations / public message board /
private monolog?
* the structure of conversations should reflect the ability to import/reference
other repositories/branches
